# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and exercises categorized into:
- **data-structure**
- **algorithms**
- **problem-statements**

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repo is for quick experimentation and practice with data structures, algorithms, and interview problems. Many examples are small snippets â€” for those, it's convenient to run a single `.cs` file without a full `.csproj`.

---

## âš¡ Run a Single C# File â€” All Options
```bash
dotnet script FileName.cs

> **Requirements:** .NET SDK 8+ for `--source` (you have 8.0.415), or install `dotnet-script` for maximum compatibility.


### Option A â€” `dotnet-script` (recommended, works anywhere)
Install once (global):
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
